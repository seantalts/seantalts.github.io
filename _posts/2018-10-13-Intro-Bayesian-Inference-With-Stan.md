# Introduction to Bayesian Inference (with Stan!)
I gave this talk at [PyData NYC
2018](https://pydata.org/nyc2018/schedule/presentation/77/).

## Description
In this talk I’ll provide a quick, intuitive foundation for Bayesian inference and discuss how to use Stan to incorporate our knowledge into a statistical model. We will then perform inference on our data and see the limits of our knowledge reified.

## Abstract
You’ve noticed that there are limits to data science. You’ve been surrounded by ad-hoc heuristics on nuanced datasets, and you’ve suspected for some time that this often leads to fragile inferences and poorly informed decision-making. You want more - you’d love to be able to incorporate more domain knowledge and really get a handle on what your data can actually tell you. Bayesian inference is the natural extension of logic to our uncertain, ever-changing world; rather than machine learning, it is machine-assisted human learning. In this talk I’ll provide a quick, intuitive foundation for Bayesian inference and discuss how to use Stan to incorporate our knowledge into a statistical model. We will then perform inference on our data and see the limits of our knowledge reified.
